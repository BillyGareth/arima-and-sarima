# ARIMA-And-Seasonal-ARIMA
Letâ€™s Break it Down:-
- AR: Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations.
- I: Integrated. The use of differencing of raw observations in order to make the time series stationary.
- MA: Moving Average. A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
